## AWS NICE DCV, Remote Gaming and Streaming Setup

This project was an attempt to replicate NVDIA GeForce Now services. 

The aim of this project was to make a remote desktop connection which would allow my PC to run high-end video games. I created this project using AWS EC2, AWS NICE DCV, RDP client, G type driver for graphic intensive tasks.
